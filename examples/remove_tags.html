<h2>JavaScript Regular Expressions</h2>

<p id="p01">Use regular expressions to search a string for HTML tags (greater and less than symbols: hexadecimal numbers 003E &#62; and 003C &#60;, respectively) remove tags and replace with null strings. The regular expression /(&#60;([^&#62;]+)&#62;)/ig uses the first capturing group to search for a &#60; symbol (u003C), then the second capturing group searches for a set containing anything that is not &#62; (u003E) indicated by the [^] (negated set) and + (quantifier: match 1 or more), then conlcudes the search with a &#62;. The modifiers i and g perform case-insensitive and global matching, respectively.</p>
