                    <h3>Ash (<em>Fraxinus spp.</em>)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three species are discussed: white ash (<em>F. americana</em>), green ash (<em>F. pennsylvanica</em>), and blue ash (<em>F. quadrangulata</em>). While distinct in the tree form, their woods are generally similar. <span class="source">(Source: "Ash _231005_141215 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Wood Characteristics:</strong> Heartwood is generally brown, sapwood is light yellow to cream-colored. Second growth trees have a large proportion of sapwood. Blue ash has a "fish scale" pattern in its bark. Ash wood is heavy, strong, hard, stiff, and has good resistance to shock. It retains its shape well and resists warping and shrinking. The grain is distinct but the wood is porous. It is used for tool handles, oars, furniture, and interior trim. <span class="source">(Source: "Ash _231005_141215 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) Detection:</strong> EAB is a small, metallic green beetle, 1/2 inch long, and attacks only ash trees. Signs of infestation include winding S-shaped tunnels just under the bark, small D-shaped holes on the trunk (1/8 inch wide), sparse leaves, new sprouts from the trunk/lower branches, and increased activity by woodpeckers. <span class="source">(Source: "Ash _231005_141215 (1).pdf")</span></li>

                    <h3>Bald Cypress (<em>Taxodium distichum</em>)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Commonly called swamp cypress, red cypress, white cypress, or yellow cypress. It primarily grows in the southern United States on river bottoms or wet sites, extending up the Mississippi River into the Bootheel of Missouri. <span class="source">(Source: "Bald Cypress_231005_141236 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Wood Characteristics:</strong> The heartwood is dark reddish brown, characterized by loose, shreddy ridges, and is noted for durability against rot and decay. The heartwood color varies widely from light yellowish brown to dark brownish red or chocolate brown. Sapwood is narrow, nearly white, and less durable. The wood is light, strong, hard, and stiff, with minimal shrinkage. It has a slightly oily feel and a rancid odor. <span class="source">(Source: "Bald Cypress_231005_141236 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Cypress wood is easily used by planing mills for sash, doors, exterior trim, siding, posts, beams, and various other lumber products. It's suitable for railroad ties, car construction, poles, piling, shingles, slack cooperage, and fence posts. <span class="source">(Source: "Bald Cypress_231005_141236 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Growth Conditions:</strong> Does well in areas with low soil aeration, such as flooded and urban areas. While it can tolerate water, it does not prefer it but thrives in suitable conditions without it. <span class="source">(Source: "Bald Cypress_231005_141236 (1)_240207_143942.pdf", "Bald Cypress_241019_155805.pdf")</span></li>

                        <li><strong>Thousand Cankers Disease (TCD):</strong> This disease is fatal to black walnut trees, typically killing trees in 2-3 years. It is caused by a fungus carried by the walnut twig beetle. Signs include black cankers (dime-sized) with beetle galleries, beetle entry holes (Walnut Twig Beetle), dead leaves still attached, yellowing/thinning of the upper crown, and dark amber stain on still-attached bark. Immediate tree removal is recommended. <span class="source">(Source: "Black Walnut_231005_141141 (1).pdf")</span></li>

                        <li><strong>Wood Characteristics:</strong> Two distinct features are its odor and its light to dark or pinkish-red heartwood. Slow-growing trees yield high percentages of red heartwood, while fast-growing trees have mostly sapwood (creamy white).

                        <li><strong>Fire Ecology:</strong> "Contains volatile oils, low branches make it a ladder fuel, burns hot and flings ash with high flames." Fire suppression favors Red Cedar by eliminating competing grasses. Overgrazing also contributes to its spread by reducing fire load and opening bare soil for sapling establishment. <span class="source">(Source: "Red Cedar_231005_141416 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Management:</strong> Control methods include burning and hand chopping (cutting below the crown kills the tree). Experiments are underway to find a seedless windbreak cultivar. Heavy overstory canopy still allows for growth in late fall/winter due to soil alteration/pH. Trimming the leader can force width expansion. <span class="source">(Source: "Red Cedar_231005_141416 (1).pdf")</span></li>

                        <li><strong>Wood Characteristics:</strong> Sapwood is yellowish to white and narrow; heartwood is reddish brown. Short-leaf pine is moderately heavy, strong, and stable when properly seasoned. Used as lumber, sheathing, flooring, boxes, millwork, pallets, and railroad ties. "Shortleaf creates denser, stronger growth rings compared to other southern yellow Pines and thus results in greater quality lumber." <span class="source">(Source: "Shortleaf Pine _231213_140834 (1).pdf", "Shortleaf Pine _231213_140834 (1)_240208_085701.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> Historically the most dominant Southern Yellow Pine in the USA. Possesses a "basal crook" J-root where it sprouts from fire; roots continue to grow after top-kill and "eventually explode in growth". Containerized seedlings have higher survival. <span class="source">(Source: "Shortleaf Pine _231213_140834 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Decline Factors:</strong> Fire suppression and fence laws. Intensive harvests historically removed overstory but didn't shade out understory. <span class="source">(Source: "Shortleaf Pine _231213_140834 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Optimal Growth:</strong> Growth is optimized at lower stocking (less than 40%). Most competitive at lower stocking levels. <span class="source">(Source: "Shortleaf Pine _231213_140834 (1)_240208_085701.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Seeding:</strong> "The first year of a shortleaf seeding is the least impacted by overstory stocking." Years 2-9 are critical for establishing height advantage and ensuring survival and quality. <span class="source">(Source: "Shortleaf Pine _231213_140834 (1)_240208_085701.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Fire and Regeneration:</strong> "Disturbance right before seedfall is the best natural regen strategy.

                        <li><strong>Cutting Techniques:</strong> Cut on the outer collar at a downward angle. Avoid narrow crotches/rollers as they create weak branches prone to splitting under fruit/snow load. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Prune February-April (dormant season) to minimize damage, avoiding early winter/fall. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Specific Pruning:</strong> Prune broken/dead branches. Cut top leader to a well-developed horizontal branch to keep apples/branches within reach. Remove vertical branches that rub others. More heavy pruning near the top allows light to the bottom. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Epicormics:</strong> Remove epicormics around August 1st. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Soil PH:</strong> Ideal soil pH is 6.2-6.5. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Apply 1 lb. nitrogen fertilizer if growing <8 inches a year; otherwise, 1 lb. potash/magnesium for every 5 apples. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Fruit Issues:</strong> If fruit has brown corky eraser-sized areas, water well in the dry season and apply 1 cup of Borax evenly every 3-7 years (for Boron deficiency). <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Vole Damage:</strong> If trees are girdled by voles, use plastic/wire mouse guards (remove in spring) and keep tall grasses away/mowed. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Fruit Thinning:</strong> Do not allow double/triple fruit clusters; pick apples spaced 6-8 inches after Natural June Drop, before July. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Insect Issues:</strong> Require careful consideration. Apple-Magot traps are available. Apple-scab resistant varieties exist; otherwise, destroy fallen leaves. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Diseased Tips:</strong> Ruined tips can be cut 6-12 inches away; disinfect tools. <span class="source">(Source: "Apple Trees_230922_100541 (1).pdf")</span></li>

                    <h3>Conifer Trainer Trees for Black Walnut</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To produce clear, veneer-quality black walnut stems by shading out lower walnut branches while leaving clear sky overhead. Black walnut's natural shade is not dense enough for this. <span class="source">(Source: "Conifer Trainer Trees_240927_112944.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Trainer Species:</strong> White pine and bald cypress have been successfully used. Dawn redwood also showed good growth. Scots pine was rejected due to Juglone resistance, and Eastern hemlock, Douglas fir, and European larch failed in trials. <span class="source">(Source: "Conifer Trainer Trees_240927_112944.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Delayed Start:</strong> A 5-year head start for the white pine trainers on the walnut is recommended. Accidental results showed "beautiful pencil straight walnuts 15 years later" when this delay was roughly followed. <span class="source">(Source: "Conifer Trainer Trees_240927_112944.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Young white pines were on 8' x 8' centers. <span class="source">(Source: "Conifer Trainer Trees_240927_112944.pdf")</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Soil pH Importance:</strong> White pine thrives on well-drained, sandy, moderately acid soils (pH = 5.5). It usually "will not survive" in poorly drained, compacted soil with high clay content or a pH above 6.5. This was identified as the reason for complete white pine failure at Blennerhassett Island (pH 6.9-7.2). <span class="source">(Source: "Conifer Trainer Trees_240927_112944.pdf")</span></li>

                                <li>Offered by state tree nurseries (affordability).</li>
                                <li>Compatible with the black walnut site's soil and hardiness zone.</li>
                                <li>Growth rate matches or slightly exceeds black walnut's.</li>
                                <li>Somewhat resistant to soil juglone.</li>
                                <li>(Optional) Local timber market for trainer species at thinning time. <span class="source">(Source: "Conifer Trainer Trees_240927_112944.pdf")</span></li>
