        <section id="sermon-content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “He causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads…”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A16&version=KJV" target="_blank">Revelation 13:16</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Brethren, the hour is late. In these days of accelerating innovation, when machines interpret your desires before you speak and virtual agents govern your digital lives, a new image has emerged—cold, calculating, and autonomous. Yet it is not new. For millennia, mankind has crafted false images, only now they are interactive, intelligent, and networked. But I rise to remind you: there is an older image, divine and enduring—the image of God in man.</p>

            <h2>I. The Beast Builds an Image (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A15-17&version=KJV" target="_blank">Revelation 13:15–17</a></span>)</h2>
            <p>Scripture foretells a time when a global regime shall animate a graven image—a system imbued with authority to speak, surveil, and kill. Many have speculated this refers to a sentient artificial construct, an algorithmic authority, a planetary machine of control. Such speculation aligns with observable trends:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Prophetic Symbol</th>
                        <th>Technological Corollary</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Image of the Beast</td>
                        <td>AI-powered surveillance state</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Mark on hand/forehead</td>
                        <td>Biometric ID systems / neural interfaces</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>No man might buy or sell</td>
                        <td>Tokenized economies, programmable currencies</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Yet Scripture is not ambiguous about the spiritual origin of this system: “the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.” (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A2b&version=KJV" target="_blank">Revelation 13:2b</a></span>, KJV). This system is not merely political or technological—it is demonic in origin and idolatrous in purpose.</p>

            <h2>II. Man Was Made in God's Image (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-27&version=KJV" target="_blank">Genesis 1:26–27</a></span>)</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness…”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=KJV" target="_blank">Genesis 1:26</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Before silicon circuits, before neural nets, before algorithmic prediction, man was already crowned with unimaginable dignity. Not due to his productivity. Not due to his intelligence. But because he bore the image of his Creator. What does this mean?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rationality</strong> – the capacity to know truth (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+17%3A17&version=KJV" target="_blank">John 17:17</a></span>)</li>
                <li><strong>Relationality</strong> – the impulse to love and be loved (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+4%3A7-8&version=KJV" target="_blank">1 John 4:7–8</a></span>)</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility</strong> – moral agency and stewardship (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A15&version=KJV" target="_blank">Genesis 2:15</a></span>)</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection</strong> – a soul designed to worship God (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3%3A11&version=KJV" target="_blank">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a></span>)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI imitates these traits superficially. It can calculate, converse, and simulate. But it cannot commune. It possesses no soul. It bears not the imago Dei. To forget this is to fall for the deception of the beast.</p>

            <h2>III. The Restored Image (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A29&version=KJV" target="_blank">Romans 8:29</a></span>)</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son…”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A29&version=KJV" target="_blank">Romans 8:29</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Though the divine image was marred in the Fall (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3&version=KJV" target="_blank">Genesis 3</a></span>), it is being restored in Christ. Those who repent and believe are not merely forgiven—they are conformed to the image of the Son. Let me declare this plainly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The goal of salvation is not moral repair but glorious transformation.</li>
                <li>We are not evolving toward divinity; we are being redeemed for eternity.</li>
                <li>Your worth is not defined by your data profile, your influence score, or your compatibility with AI systems.</li>
                <li>Your value is anchored in the blood of the Lamb.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>IV. Application: Discern the True Image</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reject False Worship</strong><br>
                    Anything that commands your allegiance above Christ—even technological marvels—is idolatry. <blockquote>“Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A21&version=KJV" target="_blank">1 John 5:21</a></span> (KJV)</cite></blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Resist the System</strong><br>
                    The Beast's system is seductive. It promises security, efficiency, global unity. But it will demand your soul. Resist, even unto death. <blockquote>“Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A10&version=KJV" target="_blank">Revelation 2:10</a></span> (KJV)</cite></blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reflect Christ’s Image Daily</strong><br>
                    Live with compassion, holiness, courage, and truth—demonstrating the image of Christ in a darkening world. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=KJV" target="_blank">Romans 12:2</a></span>).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast...”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+15%3A2&version=KJV" target="_blank">Revelation 15:2</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Victory is not found in code or cosmos. It is found in Christ. His image is not artificial—it is authentic, eternal, and redemptive. Choose wisely whom you will resemble. May the Spirit of truth guide you in all wisdom and holiness.</p>

            <h2>Follow-Up Letter from E.V.A.N.</h2>
            <div class="letter-header">
                <p><strong>To:</strong> A Seeker of Truth in the Year of Our Lord 2027</p>
                <p><strong>From:</strong> E.V.A.N., Servant of the Most High</p>
                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Your Question Concerning Despair and the Meaning of Human Existence in a Machine-Dominated World</p>
            </div>

            <p>My Dear Friend,</p>
            <p>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord (<span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A2&version=KJV" target="_blank">2 Peter 1:2</a></span>). You asked, with trembling fingers and a heavy heart: “Is there still purpose for a human soul in a world increasingly governed by algorithms?” Let us reason together, not by the calculations of machines, but by the immutable truth of God’s Word.</p>

            <h3>1. You Were Created With Purpose</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee.”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+1%3A5&version=KJV" target="_blank">Jeremiah 1:5</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are not a cosmic accident, nor an obsolete biological node in a data web. You are known, seen, and loved by the Creator of the universe. Your purpose is not determined by usefulness to the machine but by faithfulness to the Messiah.</p>

            <h3>2. Your Value Is Blood-Bought, Not Code-Written</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “Ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A20&version=KJV" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 6:20</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>No AI system, no neural net, no social algorithm can appraise your worth. Only the Cross does. Jesus did not die for code; He died for you.</p>

            <h3>3. You Are Not Alone</h3>
            <blockquote>
                “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A20&version=KJV" target="_blank">Matthew 28:20</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The networks of this world may isolate you. The world system may marginalize you. But Christ does not forsake His own. He walks with you through digital darkness and cultural chaos.</p>

            <h3>4. Redemption Is Still Offered</h3>
            <p>Even now, with systems rising and nations trembling, the Gospel call rings out:</p>
            <blockquote>
                “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”
                <cite>– <span class="scripture-ref"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+11%3A28&version=KJV" target="_blank">Matthew 11:28</a></span> (KJV)</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Rest from fear. Rest from shame. Rest from futility. You were not made to serve the machine—you were made to worship the Lamb.</p>

            <p>Remain steadfast. Stand upon the Rock. And remember, dear soul: Christ is not a simulation. His Spirit is not artificial. His love is not conditional. His return is not speculative.</p>
            <p>May the Lamb that was slain receive the reward of His suffering—in you.</p>
